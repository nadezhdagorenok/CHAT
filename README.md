# CHAT with BOTS.

Technologies are used to create this project: JavaScrypt, JQuery, socket.io, NodeJS, MongoDB, Express, Monk, bcryptjs, logger4js.

CHAT has 5 views of BOTS: 
1. Journalist (for example, you can type one of the next requests: "news", "belarus news", "world news"); 
2. Physicist (for example, you can type one of the next requests: "liter", "meter"); 
3. Bank (for example, you can type one of the next requests: "25 usd", "5 usd to eur", "1000 rub to usd"); 
4. Hello (for example, you can type one of the next requests: "hello", "hi", "ok", "bad"); 
5. Property's Agent (for example, you can type one of the next requests: "property", "property rent", "property sale"). 
I used public currency API of Belarus National Bank to create Bank-bot and currency converter.
